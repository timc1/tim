        I enjoy tinkering with new technologies, dabbling with design, and
        making things from ideation to launch. I have been working on Clips over
        the past few months using it as a tool to challenge myself to continue
        building products from beginning to end. Feel free to play with the
        hosted version on getclips.app or run your own instance/learn/build on
        top of it.

        In this post I'd like to highlight the process for building Clips â€“
        ideating and implementing, with the smaller details in between. Of
        course, these projects are my way of just playing with technologies I
        don't usually get to work with so if you have suggestions or have ended
        up learning something, please shoot me a message!

        Clips is a macOS menubar app + site that enables anyone to "clip"/save
        random, interesting things they find on the internet and stores them on
        a simple grid, accessible through a{" "}

      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        While building the site portion of the project, I realized that it might
        be nice for people to add a clip regardless of what app they're using at
        the time. So, in addition to being able to clip items from the site, I
        built a simple mac menubar app to create clips that can be toggled using
        a keyboard shortcut.

        Clips is a Next.js app deployed on Vercel. It's sitting on top of a
        MongoDB instance, uses swr for data fetching and caching, emotion for
        styling, and basic cookie authentication under the hood.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The menubar app is built using Electron, Typescript, styled-components,
        and JWTs for authentication. Feel free to fork and play with building
        your own menubar app with this setup.

        A text clip is a very simple rich text editor. Add emphasis, quotes and
        lists to easily jot down something that came to mind.

      <Paragraph>
        Link clips extends text clips by adding an unfurled link preview, useful
        for when you find a reference online that you'd like to visit in the
        future.
      </Paragraph>

      />

      <Paragraph>
        Display a list of images, along with an optional description to keep a
        record of a recent trip, or just some funny gifs. Images can be from the
        local filesystem or unfurled from a link.

        loading="lazy"
      />

      <Paragraph>
        Creating a clip is easy â€“ click the âŒ˜ icon in the navigation or press
        âŒ˜+K to bring up the shortcut menu. In the future, the menu can serve as
        a portal for other features as well. Once a clip is created, it
        immediately gets added to the current date and all subsequent new clips
        will be appended to the current date as well.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Clicking a clip will navigate to the clip's route; however, you will
        notice that we keep context of the screen you are currently on by
        rendering the page within a modal. This follows the Instagram-style
        loading of pages using Next.js's shallow routing. When refreshing the
        page at this stage, since there will be no more context, we will display
        the clip on it's own page.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Editing a clip is just as easy! Click the overflow menu and then Edit.
        Edited clips are denoted by the [edited] indicator.

      <Paragraph>
        Cool! Now that we have a nice clip put together, we can share it with
        others. Each clip is by default only viewable by yourself.

        If there is a single clip that you would like to share, opening up the

        can do â€“ make the clip publicly available for anyone to view, only
        specific people that you invite (via email), or just keep things to
        yourself!

        and linkable â€“ open the overflow menu for the edit and share options.

      <Paragraph>
        When sharing a comment, one neat thing is that the selected comment will
        scroll into view and get highlighted, keeping context.

        Notifications
      </Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        In order to keep us up to date with what interactions are happening with
        our clips, I built a simple notification system â€“ we get notified in-app
        when someone invites us to view a clip, comments on our own clips, and
        replies on clips that we are a part of. With swr, refetching and
        revalidating data was an easy option to ensure notifications, and
        effectively the entire state of the site, is up to date.

        Emails and validation
      </Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        Emails and validations was a fun one to work on. We currently send an
        email out for actions like login using an email link, reset password,
        and inviting other people to view a clip. A very simple flow for an
        invitation would go something like:
      </Paragraph>

      <ol>
        <li>A user creates a clip and adds me@timcchang.com</li>
        <li>
          A clip invitation would be created on the server under the email with
          a unique token
        </li>
        <li>
          An email would get sent with a url like
          https://getclips.app/invitations/clip?email=me@timcchang.com&clipId=12345678&token=987654321
        </li>
        <li>
          This link would navigate to a basic Next route, /invitations/:type,
          where the client would then parse and make a request to ensure that
          the params match what is on the server. The database would then be
          updated with the relevant invitation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the request is successful, we can redirect the user to the
          intended clip route and all should be good.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <Paragraph>
        Alright let's talk about some other small, fun things.

        Theming, view counts, virtualized lists
      </Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        As with any project, a light and dark theme is always a nice touch. With
        clips, I went with a simple system, light, and dark option using a
        barebones theme provider.
      </Paragraph>

      <Image
        src="/images/posts/clips/theme.gif"

        width="1500"
        height="445"
        loading="lazy"
      />

      <Paragraph>
        View counts are as simple as it gets in the project where we just ping a
        /api/views endpoint to append and return the view count for a clip. We
        can further dedupe view counts by IP, but the simplest approach is to
        just ensure `swr` does not refetch views for a really long time (24
        hours) right now and simply returns the cached value for subsequent
        visits to the clip page.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The notifications list is also virtualized! I ran into a small delay
        when rendering a huge list while testing, and this was the perfect
        opportunity to use react-virtual. There's a beauty in what virtual lists
        do to the DOM â€“ I've spent a good chunk of time just watching the nodes
        appear in and out haha.

        So while building the site, I realized that it would be really nice to
        be able to create clips anywhere when on your computer. First thing that
        came to mind was building a simple browser extension; however, I've
        always been interested in building a little menubar app, so with
        Electron and a simple React app connected to our Next.js functions, we
        can build something like this.
